The system consists of multi axle arms, hydraulic pumps, and digital optics. Being a small software team we get to dip our noses in many different layers like React GUI, Linux Applications, Yocto BSP, bus communications, and low level software for in house developed electronics. My primary focus was och the low level software, applications, and some tools needed in the testing and development, largely in Python. Before our Yocto BSP had reached the level of maturity where it could be used in the lab we set up a Docker Image. This Docker Image was used to easily set up and maintain lab computer instances needed to run the systems we developed.</div>

My task was to develop the Linux application responsible for communications between product (crane, demountable) through data bus (today serial and CAN) and cloud service. Taking the data and packaging it in JSON format to be sent via MQTT. The team was extremely distributed with colleagues in Poland, Tampere, Söderhamn, and Hudiksvall. Other tightly coupled teams can be found in India, Linköping, and Norway. The software developed is based on a "proof of concept" software that piece by piece is rewritten and expanded. All new and rewritten code are to follow C++11. Hardware layers are to be abstracted to allow for larger parts of the application to be re-used as hardware and Linux platform are subjects of change.</div>
